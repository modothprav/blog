      "content_text": "Being a Tertiary student in New Zealand can happen to be more expensive than it should be. While studying unable to work full time can have you living pay-check to pay-check as time goes by.\nHowever, there are a lot of resources, benefits and perks out there for tertiary students that can be taken advantage of while you are studying. From those available perks, this post will be discussing student bank accounts, and how you can use them to earn the best interest rate available on your savings.",

      "content_text": "When working in a multi-repository or large mono-repo project, eventually developers will have to refactor out some files and folders across from one project to another.\nAs developers reach a point where they have to start splitting up the large repository into smaller sub-repos, preserving the commit history during this migration process can be very handy for future bugs and adjustments.\nAs you may have already noticed, when simply trying to move files from one repo to another we lose any history correlated to that file and are unable to trace back any changes.",
