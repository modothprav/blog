You would have also heard that employers would like to see your personal projects and contributions to open source hosting platforms such as Github.\nI had been told the same thing when I started breaking into the industry and quickly realised that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do both at the same time.","url":"https://blog.pravinmodotholi.live/2022/04/27/automatically-contribute-leetcode-solutions-to-github/","date_published":"2022-04-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC","tags":["programming,github,tools"]},{"id":"https://blog.pravinmodotholi.live/2022/03/27/page-object-model-with-selenium/","title":"Page Object Model with Selenium","content_text":"The Page Object Model is a design pattern that is encouraged to be used during automation testing with Selenium. This design pattern creates an object repository of the web elements present on a web page. A Page object is represented as an Object-oriented class, which can contain methods that allow tests and other automation workflows to interact with the user interface of the web page.\nAdvantages One main benefit of using this design pattern is the ease of maintenance and flexibility for future changes.","url":"https://blog.pravinmodotholi.live/2022/03/27/page-object-model-with-selenium/","date_published":"2022-03-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC","tags":["programming,selenium,java"]},{"id":"https://blog.pravinmodotholi.live/2022/02/26/how-to-move-files-among-different-repos-and-retain-git-history/","title":"How to Move files among different repos and Retain Git History","content_text":"When working in a multi-repository or large mono-repo project, eventually developers will have to refactor out some files and folders across from one project to another.\nAs developers reach a point where they have to start splitting up the large repository into smaller sub-repos, preserving the commit history during this migration process can be very handy for future bugs and adjustments.\nAs you may have already noticed, when simply trying to move files from one repo to another we lose any history correlated to that file and are unable to trace back any changes.","url":"https://blog.pravinmodotholi.live/2022/02/26/how-to-move-files-among-different-repos-and-retain-git-history/","date_published":"2022-02-26 00:00:00 +0000 UTC","tags":["git,programming"]}]}
