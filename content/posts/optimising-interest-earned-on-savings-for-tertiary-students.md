Being a Tertiary student in New Zealand can happen to be more expensive than it should be. While studying unable to work full time can have you living pay-check to pay-check as time goes by.

However, there are a lot of resources, benefits and perks out there for tertiary students that can be taken advantage of while you are studying. From those available perks, this post will be discussing student bank accounts, and how you can use them to earn the best interest rate available on your savings.

## Why The Cooperative Bank

Most banks in New Zealand have some types of perks available for tertiary students, the one being discussed here is the [Cooperative Bank](https://www.co-operativebank.co.nz/everyday-banking/tertiary). This bank has three main benefits that are suitable for tertiary students. 

1. No fees on an Everyday account, including transaction fees and monthly fees.
2. No annual fee on a Debit master card.
3. A Dosh account offers you a ***2.50% APR*** on up to ***$4000*** on your savings.

The main advantage here over other banks is the 2.50% interest rate, which currently is the best interest rate being offered on a savings account. This tertiary rate is significantly higher than the rates offered by other banks which usually reside between 0.05% to 0.1% annually. 

> **Note:** This rate is only active as long as the value in the account is $4000 and under. Once the value exceeds $4000, the regular interest rate will be applied moving forward, which at the time of writing is 0.1% APR.
> 

The Cooperative Bank calculates interest daily on the Dosh account and pays it on a monthly basis. This means the *maximum* gross interest that can be received each month will be **$8.33**. 

```
Monthly Gross Interest : 4,000 x (2.50% / 12) = $8.33
```

Hence resulting in annual gross interest received to be **$99.96** (8.33 x 12).

> **Note:** The numbers calculated above are are only gross earnings, *Resident Withholding Tax* will be deducted from your account upon receiving interest.
> 

Now you may be asking how is this a good deal when the tertiary rate is applied only up to $4000. Well if you were to compare with regular interest rates offered by Cooperative and other banks, e.g. 0.1% it would take **$100,000** to be present in your savings account to *match* the gross earnings projected before.

```
Monthly Gross Interest : 100,000 x (0.10% / 12) = $8.33
```

I, unfortunately, came across this realisation just when my Dosh account with the tertiary rate was about to expire as I am not a student anymore. I hope these projections outline how good of a deal this really is.

## What to do after reaching $4,000

So to avoid making the mistakes I did, follow along on how to maintain this optimal rate, when you reach the point where your savings are about to exceed $4,000.

To ensure you get the best possible rate on your savings it is crucial that you transfer out any interest received from your Dosh savings account to another account every month. This means your Dosh account will always have $4,000 and not a dollar more. This guarantees that you are still eligible for the 2.50% tertiary rate. 

The excess transferred out cash and savings can then be directed to another account or bank moving forward, as you have already reached $4,000 on your Dosh account. I recommend opening a ***YouChoose*** or ***Direct Call*** account offered by [Heartland Bank](https://www.heartland.co.nz/savings-and-deposits), as they are the next best option in terms of savings interest rate. 

New Zealand owned Heartland bank has been awarded the best savings bank by [Canstar](https://www.canstar.co.nz/) consecutively for four years from 2018 to 2021. 

The YouChoose account has an annual interest rate of 0.5% while the Direct call account has 0.85%, with no additional fees, at the time of writing. Although not as good as the Dosh account’s 2.50%, still a lot better than the alternative options provided by other banks.

## Savings Strategy Summary

To reiterate what’s been discussed, here are the steps you’d need to follow if you are wanting to utilise this Savings Strategy.

1. Head over to the Cooperative Bank and open an everyday account and a Dosh Savings account. Make sure to bring proof regarding your duration of study, ID and proof of address. 

2. On a regular basis inject savings into your Dosh Account, till it reaches ***$4,000***. 

3. Open an account with Heartland Bank, either ***YouChoose*** or ***Direct Call*** as recommended, so you can utilise the next best savings rate. Registering with Heartland can be done online.

4. Direct your savings and interest earnings end of each month, from your Dosh Account to your other account, e.g. either YouChoose or Direct Call.
