# About
This Repo Contains my personal blog at [blog.pravinmodotholi.tech](https://blog.pravinmodotholi.tech/) built using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I decided to document what I had learned through my professional and personal experiences in the hopes of providing value to people and helping them in their own learning journey. I also figured this project will aid me towards retaining more information, so I wouldn't forget what I had learned as easily. Hence I decided to create a blog website where I can share my perspective on the things I have learned over time.

# Development
1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo)
2. Clone or Download this project `git clone https://github.com/modothprav/blog.git`
3. Enter the Root directory `cd blog`
4. Run `hugo server`
5. Access the webpage via `localhost` - according to your pc configurations.

# Deployment
The website is built using [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and hosted on Github using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The deployment workflow can be found on Hugo's [Github deployment](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#build-hugo-with-github-action) docs, and in the repo under `.github/workflows/`.
